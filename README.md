# A multi-level model analysis of lipolysis and fatty acid release from adipocytes *in vitro* and from adipose tissue *in vivo*

To generate the plots:
1. Download the files (as .zip or through git)
2. If downloaded as .zip, extract the files
3. Open MATLAB (tested on R2020a)
4. Change folder in MATLAB to the folder with the files
5. Run the script `PlotFigures`
6. Follow the instructions in the MATLAB command window to select which plot to generate. 

Note that generating high resolution plots will take some time. A low resolution option is available to save time. Again, follow on screen instructions. 
All choices should be entered as integers, e.g. `2`
